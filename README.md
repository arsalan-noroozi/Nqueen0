# N-Queens Solver

This project is a **graphical N-Queens solver** that implements three different methods to solve the problem:

1. **Genetic Algorithm**  
   A stochastic optimization method that generates a population of solutions and uses selection, crossover, and mutation to find a valid solution.

2. **Animated Backtracking**  
   The classic recursive backtracking approach, which fills the chessboard step by step and visually highlights each move.

3. **Animated CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem)**  
   A CSP-based method that ensures all constraints are satisfied and visually animates the solving process.

## Features
- Simple graphical interface using **Tkinter**  
- Animated visualization of the solution steps  
- Supports solving for any board size N  
- No external packages required (only standard Python libraries)

---

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python (3.x) is installed  
2. Run the `main.py` file:
```bash
python main.py

---

## Note
- Only `main.py` is necessary  
```
3. Enter the value of N and choose a solving method by clicking the corresponding button.
